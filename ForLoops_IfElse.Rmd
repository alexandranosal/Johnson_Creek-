For Loops
  for (i in list) {
    #do something
  }
i can be any variable, does not need to be previously defined

```{r}
list <- c(1, 3, 4, 2, 5)
new list <- NULL
second_list <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

for (i in list){
  new_list <-  c(new_list, i)
  print(c("i is now equal to", i))
  print(new_list)
}

for (i in list){
  print(c("i is now equal to", i))
  for(new_variable in second_list){
    print(c("new_variable is equal to", new_variable)
  }
}

```

```{r}

    filter(sample_key == sample_analyzed) %>%
    filter(metal == metal_analyzed)
  return(Sample)
}
